      <p>
        The City of Tallahassee has historically excluded Southside
        out of the equation when it comes to city planning and funding allocations.
        The City can spend millions of dollars to tear down homes in the name of "", but they can’t build sidewalks
        in our neighborhood or close open gutters? Well, not anymore. We’re going to change that.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, it starts with voting in the August Primary and getting involved
        in saying what our tax dollars fund. But we won’t stop there. We’ll rely
        on each other to support and build what we need to make our neighborhoods better.
      </p>

        Join us.
