      <p>
        The City of Tallahassee has historically excluded Southside from city planning and funding allocations.
        The City can spend millions of dollars to tear down our spaces in the name of "economic development",
        but they can’t build sidewalks in our neighborhoods or close open gutters? Well, not anymore.
        We’re going to change that.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, it starts with voting in the August Primary. We have a say in what does/doesn't get funded.
        But we won’t stop there. We’ll rely on each other to build what we need to make our neighborhoods better.
      </p>
      <p>
        Join us. Let's build, together.
      </p>
